# sweet-spi

Simple SPI (Service Provider Interface) for Kotlin Multiplatform (equivalent of JVM's Service Loader)

```kotlin
// module: A
@Service
interface SimpleService {
    fun saySomethingSweet()
}

// module: A, B or even in a library!
@ServiceProvider
object SimpleServiceImpl : SimpleService {
    override fun saySomethingSweet() {
        println("Kotlin is Awesome")
    }
}

// module: A, B, C or may be not even in your codebase...
fun main() {
    ServiceLoader.load<SimpleService>().forEach { service ->
        service.saySomethingSweet()
    }
}
```

## Overview

sweet-spi consists of three parts:

* multiplatform runtime with a tiny public API and all 24 supported targets
* KSP processor which generates a bit of glue code for each target
* Gradle Plugin which simplifies setup of KSP and runtime

Documentation can be found here, or on the website:

* [Project website](https://whyoleg.github.io/sweet-spi/)
* [Runtime API reference](https://whyoleg.github.io/sweet-spi/runtime-api/)
* [Gradle Plugin API reference](https://whyoleg.github.io/sweet-spi/gradle-plugin-api/)

## Features

- Easy-to-use SPI with just two annotations and two functions
- No additional setup is necessary for consumers, except for depending on your library, of course
- Automatic loading of service providers from any module or library which is available at runtime
- Automatic discovery of services based on the declaration type
- Support for providing services via objects, properties, and no-arg functions
- Support tor providing multiple services via one declaration
- Ability to explicitly specify which services should be provided by the specific service provider
- Strict identification about which interfaces could be loaded
- Supports both kotlin-jvm and kotlin-multiplatform plugins (android plugins support will be added later, not tested now, so may even work)

## Using in your projects

Compatible with Kotlin 2.0.0 and 2.0.10 and KSP 2.0.0-1.0.24+.
KSP2 is not supported because of [KSP#1823](https://github.com/google/ksp/issues/1823)
Using other Kotlin/KSP versions should still work but is not tested.

```kotlin
// In your build.gradle.kts file:

// ATTENTION: this import is REQUIRED
import dev.whyoleg.sweetspi.gradle.*

plugins {
    // apply kotlin-jvm or kotlin-multiplatform plugin 
    kotlin("multiplatform") version "2.0.0"
    // apply KSP, don't worry, Gradle Plugin will warn if you've forgotten 
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "2.0.0-1.0.24"
    // finally, apply `sweetspi` Gradle Plugin 
    id("dev.whyoleg.sweetspi") version "0.1.0"
}

kotlin {
    // just one line and we are good to go
    withSweetSpi()

    // declare Kotlin targets
    jvm()
    wasmJs { browser() }
    iosArm64()
    iosX64()
    iosSimulatorArm64()
    // and any other target
}
```

sweet-spi Gradle plugin will automatically add runtime and KSP processor dependencies to appropriate configurations:

* runtime will be added to `implementation` scope of `main` source set tree
    * if you need to expose sweet-spi to your consumers, just add `api(sweetSpiRuntime())` to `dependencies` block of the appropriate source
      set
    * it's also possible to configure sweet-spi only for specific target or even compilation using the same named extension function
      `withsweetSpi` but on `KotlinTarget` or `KotlinCompilation`
* KSP processor will be added to relevant configuration in all the same places where `withSweetSpi` is called
    * by default, KSP processor is not applied for `test` source set tree.
      For this you could manually add KSP processor there, or use `compilationFilter` parameter of `withSweetSpi` function
    * Gradle Plugin performs several checks to be sure that KSP is configured correctly.
      If for some reason it produces false-positive results, it's possible to suppress it by adding
      `dev.whyoleg.sweetspi.suppressGradleKspConfigurationChecker=true` to your `gradle.properties` file

## Manual setup without sweet-spi Gradle Plugin

As stated above, Gradle Plugin is contains just checkers and a small amount of helper functions, this means, that it's possible to use
sweet-spi without it:

```kotlin
// In your build.gradle.kts file:

plugins {
    kotlin("multiplatform") version "2.0.0"
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "2.0.0-1.0.24"
}

kotlin {
    // declare Kotlin targets
    jvm()
    wasmJs { browser() }
    iosArm64()
    iosX64()
    iosSimulatorArm64()
    // and any other target

    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
            // add runtime
            implementation("dev.whyoleg.sweetspi:sweetspi-runtime:0.1.0")
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    // Note: `ksp` configuration should be used only for jvm projects
    // it's deprecated and will be removed in KSP 2.0
    // https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-multiplatform.html#avoid-the-ksp-configuration-on-ksp-1-0-1
    ksp("dev.whyoleg.sweetspi:sweetspi-processor:0.1.0")

    // the correct way will be to apply to each target individually, 
    // Note: no need to add it to the `common` compilations, as it'd do nothing there
    add("kspJvm", "dev.whyoleg.sweetspi:sweetspi-processor:0.1.0")
    // if needed, `test` source sets support
    add("kspJvmTest", "dev.whyoleg.sweetspi:sweetspi-processor:0.1.0")
    // and for each other Kotlin target...
    add("kspLinuxX64Test", "dev.whyoleg.sweetspi:sweetspi-processor:0.1.0")
}
```

## Implementation details

* on JVM standard [ServiceLoader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html) API is used
* on other targets [EagerInitialization](https://kotlinlang.org/api/core/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin.native/-eager-initialization/) annotation is
  used.
  Note: this API is experimental/deprecated for some amount of time (AFAIK it was `deprecated` from the beginning). But, it works!

## Current status and future

Overall, I do not expect that API or implementation will change a lot, so probably it would be easier to just release 1.0.
But there are too many moving things and experimental APIs required to implement such a feature.
One of such things is mentioned above is `EagerInitialization` annotation.
The other is dependency on KSP.
While there are no real problems with using KSP, it requires manual setup on the user side.
Alternatives are:

* write compiler plugin â€“ not really a solution at the current moment, as this will require much more work compatibility wise until it
  becomes stable
* use new [Kotlin Analysis API](http://kotl.in/analysis-api) - KSP2 is based on it, so probably it should work, but it's not yet stable, not
  yet published to Maven Central.
  This is possible to overcome, but again, not perfect compatibility wises.
  Plus, it still has some bugs which required fixing for sweet-spi to work.
  F.e [KSP#1823](https://github.com/google/ksp/issues/1823) is caused by a bug in AA, and this also means that sweet-spi is not compatible
  with KSP2

Of course there could be some bugs, feel free to report them, it would really mean a lot to me!
